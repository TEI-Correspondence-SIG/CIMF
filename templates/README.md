# Templates

Here you will find templates for files according to the Correspondence Metadata Interchange format to make metadata of a scholarly editions of letters available digitally. There are two templates available, but they differ only slightly: 

* [CMIF template for printed editions](cmif-printed-edition.xml)
* [CMIF template for digital editions](cmif-digital-edition.xml). 

The template files do not validate because placeholders have been inserted instead of the real values. These placeholders briefly describe which values are to be entered here. 

For detailed explanations of the individual sections of the CMIF, see the [full documentation](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/CMIF/blob/master/doc/documentation-en.md).

If you're unfamiliar with XML and/or the TEI Guidelines, you can use the [CMIF Creator](http://correspSearch.net/creator/index.xql), provided by the research project ["correspSearch"](http://correspSearch.net).
